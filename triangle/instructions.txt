Highly Divisible Triangular Number
The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th
triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
1: 1
3: 1,3
6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.
TASK:
The task is to create program that has two options to search “Highly Divisible Triangular
Number.”
The first option is based on terms (as in Theorem 1, 3, 6, 10 etc.), program should ask from
user the ordinal (e.g. 5th) and then print out to the screen the sum and divisors of 5th term
E.g. output on screen:
15: 1,3,5,15
The program should also write a file from same event named “Divisors and sum of 5th term.txt ”
with same content as the screen output.
The second option is based on searching minimum number of divisors. So answer the question:
What is the value of the first triangle number to have over X number of divisors? The number X
should be user input value. As in the first option program should output the result on the screen
output and also write results into the file named as “The first triangle number X.txt” and X should
be the given number of user have given.
E.g. Screen output
Give minimum number of divisors triangle number should have? 6
The triangle number is 28 and divisors are 1,2,4,7,14,28
File output:
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
Program should have simple user interface (textual a.k.a command line/prompt) and should
have three options 1, 2, Q and Q


1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10
1,  3,  6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45,  55

1: 1
3: 1,3
6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
